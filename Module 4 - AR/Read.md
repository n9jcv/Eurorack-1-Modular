**3D Printed Frame for Modules**

I am building a Eurorack Modular Synthesizer. I 3D Print the frames for
the rack. The frame consists of two parts. A front panel Frame and a PCB
mount. The PCB mount is then screwed to the Front Panel Frame.

I have built 6 modules this way so far and they seem to be sturdy enough
for the purpose. Each new module I make, I just take the previous module
design and modify it for the new module. I use hot melt glue to secure
the pcb in the PCB mount.

There are some pictures here as well of the frame panel and pcb mount
with everything installed;

I use sketchup for the 3D design. I have included Sketchup files and STL
files here. Feel free to download and modify for your own designs.

I then use Photoshop to create a JPG layout for the front panel. I print
the jpg as a standard 4x6 picture at walmart for about 10 cents. The 4x6
actually has room for 2 panels, so I generally put 2 of the same on one
picture, so I get 2 panels for 10 cents.

I have included some source files here as well for the panel design.
